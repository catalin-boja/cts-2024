Code review

Stage I

Naming conventions
- names are in Romanian
- names are not following java mixed Camel Case convention
- a lot of names are meaning less - too generic

The scope of the class and the function is not visible

Stage II
- code has magic numbers
- simplify the if-else-if structure with a switch
- use enums instead of magic numbers

- there are repetitions in the math expressions (WET)

Stage III
- KISS - the function does more than 1 thing
- we still have repeating code
